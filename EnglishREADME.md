## OSS_WEB
OSS WEB is in charge of producing forms in blockchain-based consent form. **The most important thing in development was how users could easily produce consent forms.** In the planning stage, there was an opinion that it would be better for users to move blocks comfortably with a drag function using DND open source, and based on those opinions, DND open source was finally adopted
## Why We Made?
Institutions that need consent should look for the necessary forms one by one. Institutions are also considering how to deploy responsibility clauses and safety rules. I wanted to solve these considerations, and as a solution, I made three things which is **‚Äúa block containing each provision for each category‚Äù, a block layout using a drag function‚Äù ,‚Äúa preview screen‚Äù.**
